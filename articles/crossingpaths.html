              I respond, like I’m the amusing one. She reminds me that they don’t “love” things this way in Norwegian. I only have one love in my life, she says, and that is all. What can you say when you have no words to describe how you feel, that your words are not good enough to show her that you care for her? I go to tell her I love her when I leave but I do not. Instead, I choke on my tongue while we turn away from her white cottage, headed towards the city. She is not maternal but she sat next to the bed 
              each day while my grandmother was fading.
            Will she also grow old while I’m gone? <br>
             <br>

                Mother gets angry at the television, brooding over her cigarette in Nancy’s living room. They do not have enough words in this language, as if she could have sat still through a program anyway. They are always repeating themselves, using English as substitutes for words that have not yet been coined.<br><br>
              
              Did I tell her I love her? Jeg elsker deg.
              She lived half of her life surrounded by
              English, basking in our self-indulgent
              tongue, soaking in our traditions and
              lack of. Perhaps there is no reason to
              come back to her home country without her there. Is it only prolonging our pain? As I sit at the front row, all I see are the flowers covering the floor. Her friends that I will never know have come to say goodbye, though maybe they were able to say it in person like I could not.<br>

                with her mother in the front row. The
                last time I saw her, she was covered in
                seawater, holding a starfish between
                the palms of her fat baby hands. We
                climbed along the rocks, searching for
                a lost hat. Does she remember me? She
                will grow old, too, one day. It is a funny
                thing, watching your friends grow old
                and pass, leaving you behind.

          <h7>The house that my mother grew up in
              is still the same. This town never ages
              and neither does anyone but my mother.
              Everyone around her is suspended. They sit, stuck in time between each
              visit, while with each day my mother grows smaller.

              The hardest thing for me to do was to
              leave my daughters. They were angry,
              hanging in the balance of adolescence
              and childhood, searching for reasons
              in our parting. But she needed me, I
              couldn’t leave her alone. She gave me
              life and kept me with her when my
              father would no longer let me come
              home. How could I leave her now?

              recess, racing through the city to the store that her mother worked at. Randy would give us tiny lipsticks and eyeshadow samples. It was an affair for
              us, flirting with the idea of flirting, tracing our fingers around the rest of
              our lives. Be a lady. Sit, stand, fetch.

              When will our daughters play together

              how can a mother continue on without
              her children? Ninety years is a long time to live with holes burning inside my chest. We pass through each others’ lives too quickly, never paying enough attention to those in the present.

              She never grew old, only in the roots
              of her hair, which she dyed red even at 60. I miss her laughing at me, running along the cobblestone streets of our
