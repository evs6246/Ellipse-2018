          <h7>You’ve found a new apartment and now you
            need to furnish it. Smothered by student loans
            and skyrocketing rent, you’ve decided to keep
              your expenditures low and spring for some
                IKEA pieces. This is the allure of fast furniture — easy to find, cheap, and replaceable. The hidden cost, however, is a lot steeper than 
              you’d think. Fast furniture uses unsustainable
              manufacturing processes to create a low quality pastiche of craftsmanship. <br>
              <br>
              Considering the almost ten million tons of waste created a year by furniture, this is a problem that’s only getting bigger. Those chairs were built to last as long as your lease, not the duration of your life. That couch might look nice in a cute display but it’s going to look pretty bad in a landfill a few years from now. So what’s the alternative? Can we shift our way of thinking from short-term to long-term?<br></h7>
             
             <div class="green-text"><h2>FINDING FORTUNE</h2></div>
             
              <h7>Elizabeth Torgerson-Lamark is the manager of RIT Photo Services and owns a beautiful mid-century home in Brighton, NY. In her experience, the perfect piece can come from anywhere. For example, Torgerson-Lamark got lucky at Margaret’s House on RIT’s campus when she found a vintage dining
                  room table set. <br>
                  <br>
                  “It turns out they’ve been there since the center was built in the 1970ʼs, and they’ve always been there since. Torgerson-Lamark said she doesn’t care [if she takes the set] as long as she gets a table and chairs to replace it, and I’m like I’ll get you that table and chairs! She had no problem with this, so I got onto Craigslist and found a $150 oak round table and chairs and dropped them off and picked up these. Best find ever.”<br>
                  <br>
                  Torgerson-Lamark didn’t just find a high quality piece of furniture for her home, she also rediscovered the value of craftsmanship. In addition, she kept it from being tossed into a landfill a few years down the road.<br><br>

                  “We try to find things that we like and That [are] going to live a long life. I don’t like to 
                  throw away stuff. If I can avoid it, I don’t throw away anything. It either goes to consignment, resell, I give it to somebody, but I can’t literally put something on the curb… I canʼt do that.”
                  <br><br>
                  Torgerson-Lamark’s love of quality found furniture is hardly unique. She is part of a
                    larger trend of more conscious furniture buyers who buy for the long term. 
                  <br><br>
                  The O’Neil’s are also a part of this trend.
                  Patrick O’Neil and his wife, Pam, have been living on Stutson street for years. Patrick has bought up 5 houses next to each other. He lives in one and rents out the others to people. Patrick rehabs different parts of each home he has purchased — and he doesn’t take shortcuts.

            <h7>“Youʼre talking about this throw away society — ‘we canʼt afford it, itʼs too expensive’ — you think itʼs expensive to invest in linseed oil paint?” said O’Neil. “What are we going to do when we have to pay the price for lead? Well, weʼre dealing with that now. Weʼre paying the price for lead now.”<br><br>

                This way of thinking influences all of O’Neil’s purchasing decisions. “Weʼre paying the price for a lot of things. Plastic. Weʼre going to pay the price big time on that,” he continued. Of course, others think differently.</h7><br><br>
            
                <div class="green-text"><h2>BEING CONSCIOUS</h2></div>
            
            <h7>“You get to be around humans long enough, [and] you get to realize thereʼs a faction thatʼs just about money. Weʼre all about money, but there are some willing to give up anything for money,” said O’Neil. Sustainability has been irrevocably tied 
                to politics.<br><br>

                “When I talk to my more red-neck friends who poo-poo on liberal concepts, I say, youʼve got kids, grandkids…your grandfather could swim in the lake, drink the water…now you canʼt. Whatʼs it going to be like for the rest? For your kids? Grandkids? Do you want a good life for them?”

</h7>
            </div>
            
            
      </div>

         <div class="col s12  m8 l6 "><span class="flow-text"></span>
          <h7>In addition, most stores can’t compete with the convenience and speed of e-commerce, particularly Amazon. Amazon isn’t bound by traditional retail revenue models, so they can make aggressive moves to undercut brick and mortar competition without worrying about profit.² Even the most resilient brick-and-mortar business can’t keep up. <br>
              <br>
              Through one lens, it’s hard to care about the consequences 
              of a business that couldn’t modernize — nobody’s crying over losing their local Radio Shack or Sears. But the human cost of the retail apocalypse is staggering: 64,370 retail jobs were cut in 2018 alone. Many expect displaced retail workers to work in the newly created warehouse jobs, but retail jobs are very different than warehouse jobs in terms of safety and physical workload. This means that only a fraction of the jobless can easily transition to warehouse work.
             <br>
             Despite their positive reputation as job creators, Amazon’s warehouses offer miserable working conditions. Workers are stringent that some workers often choose to skip bathroom breaks in fear of losing their jobs.<br>
              <br>
              The only way to avoid this economic cataclysm is by transforming these dead spaces into  economic centers that are more relevant to the community. Defunct stores can be repurposed into cafes, health clinics, and libraries. Empty malls could be filled with affordable housing to alleviate skyrocketing rent prices. These former commercial wonderlands could transform into the new main streets of an economy that puts community first.<br></h7>

          <h7>There are real world examples 
              of this — a mall called The Arcade in Rhode Island was redeveloped to have micro-apartments on the second floor and the 100 Oaks Mall in Tennessee rented out half of the mall to a medical center.<br>
              <br>
              But, before any of that can happen, the land must be rezoned to allow non-retail stores. Eastern Hills Mall in Buffalo recently did just that, hoping to turn a largely abandoned mall into what they call a “lifestyle center district.”³ Depending on your municipality, zoning boards may be either elected or appointed by your local government officials. Petitioning your local government for this kind of change might feel like a small act, but there is strength in numbers.<br>
             <br>
             Defunct retail spaces and abandoned malls don’t have to remain monuments to the ravages of capitalism. They can be transformed to be relevant to the needs of working people. And we don’t have to capitulate to a future of brutal warehouse jobs and greater income inequality. The only way we get a future we want is by making it ourselves.<br></h7>
