          <h7>Recently, upon meeting someone for the first
              time, they politely asked me my preferred
              pronouns before engaging too deeply in
              conversation. It caught me completely off
            guard as I stuttered out an, “Um…she/her?”
              No one had ever asked me this question
              before. I am a cisgender woman. I very much
              embrace this fact in the way I present and
              carry myself. The consideration taken by this
              person to not presume my gender was new and
              foreign to me. I realized that we truly are in a time of gender revolution. The norms are being transformed from brick to water — fluid,
              transparent, and non-binary. Could the future
              be a place where gender isn’t used as a defining
              characteristic of each human? <br>
             <br>

                This genderless future has been brewing below
              the surface for decades. The current generation is not the first to call into question the outdated systems of their predecessors. Gender is a
              defining structure in our society, and breaking gender roles and blurring the lines between masculine and feminine is the ultimate social rebellion. A number of anti establishment groups, from feminism to punk rock, have
              embraced gender expression as a way to “rebuild
              the machine.”¹ The history of androgyny and gender issues is deep and complex. It calls into question individuals’ identities and how they 
              fit into society. Exploring this history can help
              put our current approach to gender in perspective.</h7><br><br>

          <h7>The term gender to describe the social and cultural characteristics of a person’s biological sex was
              first widely used in the 1950s. This was a time
                when strict gender roles were being re-established after being partially blurred during World War II.
              Women in the 1960s challenged these gender norms 
              by tearing into their closets and radicalizing them.
              This led to the gender neutral fashion trend which was linked closely to second-wave feminism. However, this style was homogeneous and leaned masculine. The ‘70s was a flourishing time of androgyny — the combination of masculine and feminine characteristics. Punk culture, where men wore eyeliner and women wore leather jackets with sneakers, began to develop during this period.
              The Peacock Revolution took over the culture in 
              London as homosexuality became legalized.² Gay and straight men alike began to feel comfortable embracing “feminine” elements of clothing, creating a culture that celebrated individuality and a creative spirit. Rock stars like Elton John, David Bowie, and Mick Jagger pushed this style into pop culture, which led to acceptance on a global scale.
                <br>
              <br>
              The 1970s were an important decade for laying
              the foundation of our contemporary discussion
              about gender fluidity. During this decade, people were about gender fluidity. This generation was
              very concerned with redefining gender stereotypes.
                Some of the first in depth scientific gender studies
              were conducted during this time, and new scientificresearch showed that gender roles were in fact 
              learned. Toys and clothes for children leaned gender neutral. Television shows and movies took this a step further by showing boys playing with dolls and girls working on cars.³</h7>

          <h7>Psychologist Sandra Bem argued that “traditionally, society has not encouraged the development of both masculine and feminine characteristics 
              within the same individual but that psychological androgyny can expand the range of behaviors available to everyone.”       In fact, creative individuals of both biological sexes were more likely to possess and express both masculine and 
              feminine characteristics.
              <br>
              <br>
              Another psychologist Jodi Weinstein found 
              that, “in being androgynous, especially in a sex-stereotyped society, a person would need to be open to experience, flexible, accepting of apparent opposites, unconcerned about social norms, and self-reliant — exactly those traits identified with creative persons.”⁴ This psychological element could explain why so many of our culture’s icons across the decades have explored androgyny.
              <br>
             <br>
             Icons such as Grace Jones and Prince kept this tradition alive in the 1980s. However, just as the women of the 60s rebelled against the gender stereotypes of the 50s, the people of the 80s reacted to the aggressive non-gendering of the 70s. This decade bounced back to clearly gendered clothing, and resulted into the Princess Industrial Complex.⁵ The 1990s began to correct this through grunge culture, with icons such as Kurt Cobain donning eyeliner and floral print dresses.
              <br><br>
             Third wave feminism sought to question, reclaim, and redefine ideas about gender, sexuality, femininity, and masculinity. There was a decided shift in perceptions of binary gender, leading to the concept of a gender continuum.<br><br>
              
              From this perspective, each person is seen as possessing, expressing, and suppressing the full range of “masculine” and “feminine” traits. A major goal of this process is first
              becoming conscious of the ways one’s gender identity and sexuality have been shaped by society and then intentionally constructing 
              (and becoming free to express) one’s authentic gender identity.⁶ This way of thinking is becoming the new normal in contemporary society. This ebb and flow throughout history has resulted in a more malleable gender construct. However, with Donald Trump in the White House, and our current country’s divide between new and old ways of thinking, are we in danger of reverting back to the gender stereotypes of the 50s and 80s? What makes our current conversation different? How can we ensure that the future of gender is fluid, a true continuum in which each and every unique gender expression (or lack thereof) is accepted? 
              <br><br>
              Change is scary and we’re already seeing these growing pains manifest themselves in fights about bathroom usage and attacks on transgender individuals. People feel threatened by change, especially when they are unsure of where they fit into this new society. Not being able to place people in these neat, little boxes is
              uncomfortable. Pushing past the discomfort and seeking understanding of a different culture is the best way to develop as a human. Ask, just as my friend did, how people identify themselves. If we as humans are open to truly understand and accept people’s preferred gender expression, the future could truly be non-binary.</h7>
