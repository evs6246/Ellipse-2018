          <h7>Forty-seven percent of U.S. workers have a high probability of seeing their jobs automated over the next 20 years.1 That shocking statistic comes from a study from Oxford University. You’re notgoing to show up one day at work with a robot sitting at your desk, but you may very well show up to find a pink slip from your boss. Your expensive college degree won’t meanmuch when there simply aren’t enough jobsto go around. Our solution to the oncomingwave of technological unemployment may bethe question of our time. The Fourth Industrial Revolution looms, and it’s vital that we have avoice as to how it plays out. AI Automation is a tool – an astoundingly powerful tool, but a tool nonetheless. In the right hands, it can be used to transform our world for the better. For example, Google’s DeepMind used AI to diagnose eye disease with a 94.5 percent accuracy rate.2 But right now, it’s exclusively in the hands of gargantuan global corporations who more often put profit before human life – just as it was in the previous Industrial Revolutions.<br>
              <br></h7>
              
            <div class="orange-text"><h10>OLD IS NEW AGAIN</h10></div> 
              
          <br>
          
          <h7>AI Automation is, at its core, a labor saving
              technology like any other machine. Take the
              cotton gin, created by Eli Whitney. By making
              the labor easier and more efficient, Whitney
              hoped that his invention would end slavery. The
              cotton gin automated the process of separating
              freshly harvested cotton – “One man and a horse will do more than fifty men with the old machines,”
              wrote Whitney to in a letter his father.3</h7><br>
             <br>
             <h7>Instead, the hyper-wealthy antebellum gentry used the cotton gin to exponentially increase their profits – and create the most brutal form of chattel slavery the world has ever seen. Much like the cotton gin, automation
                 hopes to increase productivity. While there’s no doubt AI Automation can and will achieve that, the human cost of this boost may be incalculable. Nobody building automated systems intends on making the world a worse place, but neither did Eli Whitney. <br><br>

                 We won’t live to see a post-work world in the same way a factory worker from the 1800s 
                 didn’t. Even though the machines these workers operated were the most productive in human history, workers actually worked more hours, not less; workers were forced to pull 10 to 16 hour shifts six days a week in dangerous factories. And while the burden on workers increased, factory owners became fabulously wealthy.<br><br>
                 
                 Workers fought back by organizing labor unions; they used slowdowns, strikes, and sabotage to advocate for a fair work-life 
                 balance. In turn, the wealthy elite hired private police to suppress workers and lobbied the state to pass anti-union legislation. Because of this, the United States has had perhaps most violent labor history of any industrial nation in the world.⁴ Only after decades of bloodshed were workers afforded the few rights they now have.<br><br> </h7>

                 <h7>The effect of automation on the job market is already palpable. America’s manufacturing jobs didn’t go overseas, it simply became cheaper to automate the work with more intelligent machines. Workers were laid off armed with an obsolete skillset and no clear source of income. Now imagine this pattern 
                 but with computers that can more and more accurately emulate the human touch. The pattern will not only repeat itself, but 
                 increase in intensity.<br><br>

                 The response to this is not to become a Luddite. Good or bad, AI Automation is coming. We must demand and agitate for it to be used in a way that benefits humanity.
                 There have been small, limited actions. For example, several of Google’s software engineers quit their jobs over the company’s agreement to develop AI for the military.⁵ But it will take a much larger organization
                 of both white and blue collar workers to dictate how AI Automation will be utilized. Like the laborers of the past, we must agitate for our rights as workers to be recognized. But what about the workers left behind?<br><br></h7>
                
                <div class="orange-text"><h10>THE FORGOTTEN IDLE</h10></div><br>
             
                <h7>An often discussed solution to technological unemployment the creation of a Universal Basic Income, where an income is earned simply by being a citizen. This solution is vague at best; there are no specific proposals, making discussion of UBI abstract instead of immediate. But there’s one big hurdle the UBI must cross, regardless of the plan’s specifics: public acceptance.<br><br>

                    “For the labors of thirty or forty honest and industrious men shall not be consumed to maintain a hundred and fifty idle loiterers,”
                    announced John Smith, governor of the early
                    American Jamestown colony.⁶ But if those 30 or 40 industrious men – aided by AI Automation – could easily provide enough for the rest of the community? Would we soften our distaste for the idle loiterers who have no work, or would we continue demonize them as lazy?<br><br>

                    Considering that politicians support slashing benefits and adding work requirements to welfare, the answer more likely the latter. Regardless of how bad the economy gets, there will always be a vocal contingent of people who despise people they consider unfit and lazy. It is vital to the future that we deplatform people who would punish the unemployed and give the underemployed poor a voice. A social transformation must occur, one in which a person is valued not for their productivity but their humanity. Because whether we think it or not, we’re one algorithm away from being a so-called idle loiterer.<br><br>

                    The fruits of the Fourth Industrial Revolution must be enjoyed amongst the people, not the hyper-wealthy elite. The only way we can achieve this is by organizing as workers and citizens. The alternative, simply put, 
                    is a world of catastrophic inequality.<br><br>
