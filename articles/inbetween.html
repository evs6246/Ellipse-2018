                space for a diverse body of individuals to share their experience as shaped by identity. Race. ethnicity, 
                religion, gender identity, sexuality, disability. However,
                where do those of us at a unique intersection of identities look for representation? How often do we 
                open up conversation around identity that fits no mold,
                not even in the marginalized representation that already exists?
                <br>
                <br>
                As we move deeper into a direction that honors both
                representation and individuality, we also must open the space for a new generation of voices to emerge, listen, and embrace a narrative that is not as structured as what we have known.

                <div class="grey-text"><h7>The first time I tell anybody out loud that I have feelings for a girl, I am at my church’s youth group retreat. I tell my best friend’s older sister, cross legged outside of our cabin at 3 a.m., taken aback at my own bravery to tell a practical stranger.<br><br>

                    Shame settles into my chest as I wait my turn to
                    take communion on Sunday, and the pastor reminds us that we should not partake if we are holding something from God. <br><br>

                    I shake my head no at sleepovers when my friends ask me if I like anyone.<br><br>

                    In 7th grade, I wait in line for the yearbook photos to be taken. I pose, self consciously, widening my eyes as the photographer counts down. I tell myself, if only I were white, I’d be much happier.<br><br>

                    My friend tells me that Asians are either really ugly or really pretty. She tells me I’m lucky I’m one of the pretty ones. My friends tell a racist joke about Asians as I stand uncomfortably in their circle. <br><br>

                    They tell me that it does not apply to me. I’m one 
                    of them after all. They do not see me as Asian.
                    I go to college and meet people who are queer and liberal and everything that my hometown is not. 
                    I’m afraid to tell these people that I still believe 
                    in God.<br><br>
                    As an Asian American adoptee, it took me a long time to understand myself — in accepting, exploring,
                    and appreciating what it means to be Asian, but also having an experience that differed from non American Asians, and even from Asian Americans who were raised with a cultural or familial tie to their ethnic identity. Growing up, I was in a sense, both Asian and white. At the same time, I was neither Asian nor white. My identity was overwhelmed 
                    by  a sense of otherness, and I felt that I 
                    existed in between. <br><br>

                    I still believed in God, but what did it look like to engage with both queerness and a faith that traditionally condemned it? My queerness felt at odds with my Christianity, and the complexity of how each lens of my own identity allowed me to see the world became a confusing space to navigate. <br><br>

                    I searched for myself in the representation of queer Asians, or Asian adoptees, or those at peace with both their sexual or gender identity and their religion. I never saw another version of myself when I needed it most. <br><br>

                    My identity became an unraveling. Had I seen myself in others, would things have changed? </h7>

                    <h7>Every rest day the four of us would reach out for God, but I knew he only had enough room in his arms for
                        three. I tried to make him see the plain truths that were hidden in my silences but trying to make a black father accept that you do indeed have an affinity for all humans is like getting someone to understand that the absence of light is darkness. <br><br>

                        Time and time again and day after day I could not bring myself to move my lips to get the words to come out.  And just as sure as the hands of the clock are to strike the number twelve, I failed every chance I could. My lips would not part. Until one day when they did.<br><br> 

                        One of those days I slipped. For a fraction of a second, I forgot where I was and who I was and I thought that those whispered words had made their way to his ears. They didn’t. And even though they didn’t, I thought about ending it all. But if I had decided to jump into a pool and sit at the bottom, I know I would have held my breath. So, I didn’t. Jump that is. <br><br>

                        I decided to live and to continue on. My father never did hear those words or at least if he did he never let them escape another pair of lips. Every rest day when I’m home we still reach out to God, but instead of
                        reaching out to Him I just sit there in the same hidden silence. The silence that still haunts me to this day. For this is the burden of being a black crow in a world full of snow.<br><br></h7>

                        <h8>I am James Porras, and I identify as Mexican American, gender queer, and bisexual.</h8><br><br>
                    <h7>I always felt different — I understood the differences between male and female, but I didn’t understand why those differences existed. Growing up in a Mexican community in El Paso, Texas, I was aware of the difference in how my gender and sexual orientation was perceived, but I was too scared to go against the social normatives until I moved to upstate New York for school, where people were both proud and welcoming. <br><br>

                        In Rochester, I felt welcomed, but I don’t think it is easy to feel completely comfortable when you look and act differently. I had always been so judgmental of myself for the aspects that I am now proud of. 
                        I identify as a genderqueer male. I don’t mind she/her pronouns, but respect it most when people ask before making assumptions. There are times when my body does not look as masculine as I want it to, but I would never undergo body modifications to please other people. <br><br>

                        When I model, I feel strong as a fierce female character, but weak and lost when I am pressured to portray a masculine subject. My body is male, and I am male, but this does not mean that my mentality follows the same rules as most males abide to. There is a whole social aspect in the way you should act, talk, or even walk.<br><br></h7>

                    <h7>Knowing that we all have similar problems, emotions, and stories to relate to comforts me in my placement within any community. My identities have both empowered me and humbled me. <br><br>

                        The world is going towards a gender revolution, and I want to be a part of it by fighting back stereotypes and old-fashioned ideals. <br><br>

                        We are humans, and we are diverse in all aspects. <br><br>

                        The people that have disrespected me don’t know what it means to feel outside the structure that society has created, and they don’t fully understand how 
                        comments of endearment are at times, actually hurtful. <br><br>

                        General education does not teach this subject, so our media must. My identity elevates my art as a photographer, and allows me to touch people’s hearts, open their eyes, and enables their brains 
                        to be nourished by the light of this revolution of 
                        gender and sex as more than just an identity.<br><br></h7>
